This is the first post of my blog, and I want to start by stating the purposes.
Before I begin, let me talk about my background.
Currently, I work as a full-time software developer making an enterprise application.
Believe it or not, software engineering is an opinionated world.
Rigid mathematics and science are not enough for you to survive in this industry.
There are issues of ~~politics~~ communication, management, leadership, and other subjects of liberal arts.
I love such an environment where disciplines from science and humanity are combined.
Please keep in mind that my opinions are often coming from the context of software development.

#### Receiving criticisms

You may already heard about the story of frog in the well.
As [Zhuang Zhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuang_Zhou) explained, "a frog in a well cannot discuss the ocean, because he is limited by the size of his well."
No matter how smart I think I am, there must be a person who is smarter than me.
By exposing my thoughts to the world, I would have higher chance of receiving constructive criticisms.
I appreciate people who criticize me because they expand my world view.
Furthermore, the feedback will be very ~~aggressive~~ honest since they are anonymous :)
As [Friedrich Nietzsche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) said, "what does not kill me makes me stronger."

#### Organizing thoughts

Writing helps me organizing my thoughts.
The process is similar to the writing an essay in school.
I do some research, create thesis statement, make an outline, write paragraphs with topic sentences, conclude, and double check the content.
In other words, I nurture my vague thoughts into the concrete points.

#### Building community

Obviously, I want many people to read my blog and discuss the subjects together.
Some of them may hate my opinion and criticize me, which is good as I explained above.
Others may like my opinion, and they will become my ~~comrades~~ followers.
Having my own community proves two things:
1. I am able to convince people, which is an important skill of leadership.
1. I am not just a random dude. There are people who supports my ideas.
Besides the above ~~flex worthy~~ benefits, I personally enjoy discuss or debate with people on the subjects I am interested in.
What's the point of life if we don't mess around with each other? :)

#### Self introduction

You, a reader of my blog, might be a potential coworker or even an employer.
You will figure out my philosophies on working from this blog.
Are you interested in working with me?
Feel free to ~~stalk~~ see what kind of person I am :)
